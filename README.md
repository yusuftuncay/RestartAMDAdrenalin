# About

Automatically resets AMD Adrenalin when a game is launched. Kills all AMD processes and services, then restarts Adrenalin and closes its window, fixing the overlay issue, performance or driver issues without any manual steps

# How It Works

1. Scans installed games from Steam, Epic, Riot, and Rockstar
2. Watches for any of those games to start
3. Waits 2 seconds, then kills all AMD processes and services
4. Restarts AMD Adrenalin and closes its window
